Read [Get Started in LazTech Group](https://www.overleaf.com/9279691msypmpcjnpqp#/33470921/). The essential basics of physics is stated here. Make sure you read this. Here are several questions:
​      1. What is VGT? Can you explain it in theory and algorithm?
​      2. Can you run the code without error? Why?
​      3. What's the code talks about? What's the result?
​      4. How long did it take? Can it be improved?



## 2. Software Requirements 

These are the softwares that all members will use in their life. Some are covered in the previous section, some are not. 

So, install / try to use these great softwares to improve your coding life:

1. **Julia (0.6.4, and 1.0.0), Python.** Make sure you understand: Basic Julia syntax. Matrix operation. Install/Call Julia module. Call python module. Some libraries in Julia: `HDF5`, `Stats`.Some libraries in Python: `numpy`, `matlibplot`, `astropy`.  (Some questions will be throw later)
2. **Github**. Also learn to use
3. **Anaconda (prefereably 2), Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab**. I know you can just use commandline, but these are great tools that will accelerate your workflow. Besides, @Mike will post some tutorials using the Jupyter Notebook. (If you have trouble install, you can try use these: [Julia Pro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html), Atom (with uber-juno extension)).
4. **Teamviewer** and **VNC Viewer** for remote access to our protal.
5. [**Typora**](https://typora.io/) for [markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/) documentation. You can even use Typora to write some LaTeX, which makes your life much more visualized and easier.
6. **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)**. The formal platform to write and generate our LaTeX-based papers. Note that Typora can't do serious LaTeX. Overleaf allows us to share the paper with group members and edit it altogether. Get used to LaTeX and try it.
